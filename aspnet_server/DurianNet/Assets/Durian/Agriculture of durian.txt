Agriculture of durian
Best season to plant durian trees.
The best season to plant durian trees is typically at the beginning of the rainy season. This ensures the young trees receive enough water to establish their root systems. In Southeast Asia, this is usually around April to June, depending on the local climate.

How much water does a durian tree need.
Durian trees require consistent moisture but should not be waterlogged. Young trees need around 20-30 liters of water weekly, while mature trees require 40-50 liters, especially during dry periods. Watering should be reduced once fruits start developing to avoid overly watery flesh.

Best soil type for growing durian.
Durian trees thrive in well-draining, loamy soil that is slightly acidic, with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5. The soil should be rich in organic matter and located in areas with good drainage to prevent root rot, as durian trees are sensitive to waterlogged conditions.

How long does it take for a durian tree to bear fruit.
On average, durian trees take about 5 to 8 years to bear fruit if grown from seedlings. Grafted trees, however, may start producing fruit as early as 3 to 5 years. The time to bear fruit can vary based on tree variety, care, and growing conditions.

Recommended durian varieties for cultivation.
Popular durian varieties for commercial cultivation include Musang King (D197), D24, and Black Thorn. These varieties are highly marketable and produce high-quality fruit that is in demand. Other varieties like Monthong and Chanee are also popular in Thailand.

How to plant a durian tree.
To plant a durian tree, first select a sunny location with well-draining soil. Dig a hole about 1-1.5 feet deep and wide enough to accommodate the roots. Place the seedling in the hole, backfill with soil, and water thoroughly. Mulch around the base to retain moisture and suppress weeds.

Fertilizer requirements for durian trees.
Durian trees benefit from a balanced fertilizer with a mix of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Young trees need more nitrogen to promote leaf growth, while mature trees require higher potassium levels to enhance fruit quality. Organic matter like compost is also beneficial.

Common pests and diseases affecting durian trees.
Durian trees are susceptible to pests such as aphids, fruit borers, and mealybugs. Common diseases include Phytophthora (root rot), anthracnose, and leaf blight. Regular inspection, pruning, and proper drainage help prevent infestations and diseases.
