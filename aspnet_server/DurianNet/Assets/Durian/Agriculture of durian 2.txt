Agriculture of durian 2

Ideal climate for growing durian.
Durian trees thrive in tropical climates with temperatures of 24-30°C (75-86°F), high humidity, and 1500-2000 mm annual rainfall, without prolonged dry seasons.

When to prune a durian tree.
Prune annually after fruiting to maintain shape, remove dead branches, and improve sunlight penetration for healthier growth and higher yield.

How to propagate durian trees.
Durian trees are best propagated by grafting for faster fruiting and consistent quality. Seed propagation is slower and produces variable results.

How to improve durian fruit yield.
Ensure consistent watering, balanced fertilization, good soil drainage, pruning, pest control, and mulching. Opt for high-yield varieties like Musang King.

Steps to plant a durian tree.

Choose a location: Sunny area, well-drained soil, pH 5.5-6.5, with 10-12 meters spacing.
Prepare the soil: Dig a 1-1.5 ft hole, loosen the soil, and mix in compost.
Plant the seedling: Place upright, backfill soil, and firm gently.
Water: Water immediately and keep soil moist.
Mulch: Add organic mulch to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
Support: Stake young trees if needed, using soft ties.
Care: Fertilize, prune, and protect from pests and diseases.
How much sunlight does a durian tree need.
Durian trees need 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth and fruiting.

Can durian trees grow in high altitudes.
Durian trees prefer low altitudes below 800 meters (2600 feet), as cooler temperatures and lower humidity at higher altitudes hinder growth.
